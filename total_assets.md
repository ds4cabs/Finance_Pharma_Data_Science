Calculating total assets involves summing up all the assets a company owns. Assets can be broadly categorized into current assets and non-current (or long-term) assets. Here's a step-by-step example:

### Example Company Balance Sheet Data

#### Current Assets
1. Cash: $50,000
2. Accounts Receivable: $30,000
3. Inventory: $20,000
4. Prepaid Expenses: $5,000

#### Non-Current Assets
1. Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE): $150,000
2. Intangible Assets (e.g., patents): $25,000
3. Long-term Investments: $10,000

### Calculation

1. **Current Assets**:
   - Cash: $50,000
   - Accounts Receivable: $30,000
   - Inventory: $20,000
   - Prepaid Expenses: $5,000
   - **Total Current Assets**: \( 50,000 + 30,000 + 20,000 + 5,000 = 105,000 \)

2. **Non-Current Assets**:
   - Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE): $150,000
   - Intangible Assets: $25,000
   - Long-term Investments: $10,000
   - **Total Non-Current Assets**: \( 150,000 + 25,000 + 10,000 = 185,000 \)

3. **Total Assets**:
   - **Total Current Assets**: $105,000
   - **Total Non-Current Assets**: $185,000
   - **Total Assets**: \( 105,000 + 185,000 = 290,000 \)

### Summary
- **Total Current Assets**: $105,000
- **Total Non-Current Assets**: $185,000
- **Total Assets**: $290,000

This example shows how to sum up both current and non-current assets to arrive at the total assets of a company.

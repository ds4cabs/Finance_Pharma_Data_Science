To make a tax report for your Airbnb income and potentially reduce your taxable income, follow these steps:

### 1. **Organize Your Financial Records:**
   - **Income**: Track all rental income received from your Airbnb guests.
   - **Expenses**: Track all expenses related to your Airbnb rental. These might include mortgage interest, property taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs, maintenance, supplies, cleaning fees, and Airbnb service fees.

### 2. **Determine Rental Use:**
   - If you live in the house and rent out only a part of it, you need to allocate expenses between personal use and rental use. You can generally do this based on the number of rooms rented out compared to the total number of rooms in the house or based on the square footage used for rental purposes.

### 3. **Deductible Expenses:**
   - **Direct Expenses**: Costs directly related to the rental activity (e.g., repairs in the rented rooms, cleaning fees).
   - **Indirect Expenses**: Costs related to the entire property (e.g., mortgage interest, property taxes, utilities) allocated based on rental use.
   - **Depreciation**: You can depreciate the portion of your house used for rental purposes over 27.5 years.

### 4. **Filing Schedule E:**
   - **Form 1040**: Report your rental income and expenses on Schedule E (Supplemental Income and Loss) of your Form 1040.
   - **Rental Income**: Enter the total rental income received on line 3 of Schedule E.
   - **Expenses**: Enter deductible expenses on lines 5 through 19 of Schedule E. Ensure you allocate expenses appropriately between rental and personal use.

### 5. **Other Considerations:**
   - **Self-Employment Tax**: If you provide substantial services to guests (like a hotel), your income might be considered self-employment income, subjecting you to self-employment tax. Report this on Schedule C instead of Schedule E.
   - **Qualified Business Income Deduction**: If your rental activity qualifies as a business, you may be eligible for the 20% qualified business income deduction under Section 199A.

### 6. **Consult a Tax Professional:**
   - Tax laws can be complex, especially regarding rental properties and mixed-use homes. Consulting with a tax professional can ensure you maximize your deductions and comply with IRS regulations.

### Example of Schedule E Entry:

| **Income**        | **Amount**    |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Rental Income     | $20,000       |

| **Expenses**                  | **Amount**     |
|-------------------------------|----------------|
| Mortgage Interest             | $4,000         |
| Property Taxes                | $2,000         |
| Utilities                     | $1,200         |
| Repairs and Maintenance       | $800           |
| Cleaning and Supplies         | $600           |
| Airbnb Service Fees           | $1,000         |
| Depreciation                  | $2,500         |
| **Total Expenses**            | **$12,100**    |

| **Net Rental Income (Loss)**  | **$7,900**     |

By properly categorizing and reporting your income and expenses, you can effectively manage your Airbnb rental activity for tax purposes and potentially improve your profitability.
